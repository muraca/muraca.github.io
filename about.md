I'm a curious software engineer, particularly interested in modern programming languages and technologies.  
I'm currently working with Rust in the blockchain field.  
In this blog, I write about my contributions to open source projects, my experiments with new technologies and my thoughts about software development.

I was born in 2000 in the south of Italy, where I currently live.  
I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with honours at Università della Calabria in 2021.  
Then, I briefly attended a Master's Degree focused on Sound and Music Computing at Università degli Studi di Milano.

*I will eventually add something about my previous job, the Polkadot Blockchain Academy, and other stuff*
